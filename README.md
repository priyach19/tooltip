# Tooltip App
In this react project, tooltip is created based on position defined by the user. I used react-tooltip library for this.

## Steps to run the application:
1. Install all packages needed first by the following command:
     ```
      npm install
     ```
2. Run the project by the command :
     ```
      npm start
     ```
